# Neighborhood Map
## Project Overview
I will develop a single-page application featuring a map of my neighborhood or a neighborhood I would like to visit. I will then add additional functionality to this application, including: map markers to identify popular locations or places Iâ€™d like to visit, a search function to easily discover these locations, and a listview to support simple browsing of all locations. I will then research and implement third-party APIs that provide additional information about each of these locations (such as StreetView images, Wikipedia articles, Yelp reviews, etc).

## Installation and Running the Game
